    <h1>Christian Guerra</h1>
    <p>I am a third-year Data Science major at UCSD with a passion for machine learning, web development, and leveraging data to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, data analysis, and statistical modeling. I am particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and human-centered design, where technology can make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

        Through hands-on projects and internships, I have honed my skills in Python, Java, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experiences include developing classification models, creating responsive websites, and exploring data visualization techniques to uncover insights.
        
        This portfolio showcases my dedication to continuous learning and my ambition to apply innovative solutions in diverse domains. Whether it's building intelligent systems, enhancing user experiences, or analyzing complex datasets, I am committed to making a difference. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find my work inspiring!</p>
